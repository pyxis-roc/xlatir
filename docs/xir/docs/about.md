The Translatable Intermediate Representation (XIR) Project provides a set of tools for instruction set semantics "engineering". It allows you to specify instruction set semantics using a Python-like domain-specific language called XIR. An XIR specification can then be translated into other languages to generate fast interpreters, or for automated theorem proving, or for testing, etc.
